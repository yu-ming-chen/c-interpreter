# Project Name: C Interpreter

This is a C interpreter written in TypeScript to interpret a sublanguage of C. The front end of this project is built using React.

## Setup

To set up this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the backend directory using your terminal, and run the command `npm start` to start the server.
2. Open another terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory using your terminal, and run the command `npm start` to start the React app.

The server will be running on `localhost:3000` and the React app will be running on `localhost:3002`.

## Usage

Once the server and React app are running, you can use the interpreter by navigating to `localhost:3002` in your browser.
You should be able to see the following page then click `Continue` to proceed:

2. Click the `Execute` button to run the code.
3. The output will be displayed in the output area on the right.
